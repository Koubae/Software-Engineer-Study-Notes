## 🧮 Is Pre-University Algebra the Same as Linear Algebra?

**No**, they are **not the same** — they refer to **different branches** of mathematics, though they share the word "algebra".

### ✅ **1. Pre-University Algebra (aka “Elementary Algebra”)**

This is what you typically learn in high school (GCSEs / A-Levels). It's foundational and **must be mastered before university**.

#### It includes:

- Solving **equations** (linear, quadratic)    
- Working with **algebraic expressions**    
- **Manipulating variables**    
- **Factorising** and expanding    
- **Inequalities**    
- Graphing basic functions    

🧠 **Purpose**: Build general problem-solving and symbolic reasoning skills — essential for _all_ advanced math.

### 📐 **2. Linear Algebra (University-Level)**

Linear Algebra is a **specific field** of mathematics you’ll encounter **during your Bachelor’s**. It deals with mathematical structures that are linear (straight-line-like).

#### It includes:

- **Vectors** and vector operations    
- **Matrices** and matrix multiplication    
- **Solving systems of equations** using matrices    
- **Determinants** and **inverses**    
- **Eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors** (advanced)
    

🧠 **Purpose**: It underpins many areas of computer science:

- Graphics and 3D transformations    
- Machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks)    
- Optimization and systems modeling
