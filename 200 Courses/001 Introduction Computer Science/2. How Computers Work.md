### Tools & Softwares


* modularity
* notional machine
* state
* drivers
* The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
### Resources



### Notes

* Abstraction
* Notional Machine
	* Computing Pedagogy
* CPU -- Central Processing Unit
* RAM -- Random Access Memory


### Notional Machine

* Computing Pedagogy
* Mental Model

* 

### State

* [State (computer science) -- wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science))
* [state space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space "State space")

**File States**

* closed -- idle
* locked (an application opens the file)
* copy to memory  (2 copy 1 hard disk other memory)


### Debugging

* understanding the system
* Look , don't think
* Make it fail
* Change 1 thing at time


## Networks

* protocols
* router
* packet
* encryption
* public key encryption
* search-space



1.

Yes, I've choosen Youtube. since Is a tool that i se quite often, is quite complex (so there is something to talk about) and is very popular, at the same time it has some components that are similar to coursera (comment section, video player and so on)

Youtube must have:

1. search engine (to search videos based on user inputs) 
2. List videos
3. display videos
4. buffer the video
5. translations, 
6. comment sections

2.

I've used Youtube for years and I simply know it well enough. 
However, thanks to the material study i can create a "graph" and mental model of a Notional machine

3.
Yes. First we should identify which type of "data"

1. "personal" data or "account" data . which can be username, bio description for personal one while account data is Account preferences, settings and so on.
2. Content related data: For example whether or not you put a like in a video, showing liked videos, show video history , personalized content (which youtube is notorious) , playists and so on..

best part: 

Youtube is interesting tool, and quite complex so is very exicting to think on how it work

weknessses: 
Not being able to see how it's actually built.
